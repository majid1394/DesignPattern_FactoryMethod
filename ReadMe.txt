//In this example, the `Product` interface defines the common behavior for all products.
// The `ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB` classes implement this interface with their own specific implementations.
// The `ProductFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of these concrete products based on the input type.
// The client code then uses the factory to create and interact with the products without needing to know the specific implementation details.



1. Encapsulation: The Factory Design Pattern encapsulates the object creation process, allowing the client code to interact with objects through a common interface without needing to know the specific implementation details.

2. Flexibility: By using factories to create objects, the Factory Design Pattern allows for easy extension and modification of the object creation process. Adding new types of objects or changing the way objects are created can be done without modifying existing client code.

3. Code Reusability: Factories promote code reusability by centralizing the object creation logic. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase.

4. Simplified Client Code: Clients using the Factory Design Pattern do not need to be aware of the concrete classes being instantiated. They only need to interact with the factory interface, making the client code simpler and more readable.

Utilities, on the other hand, provide a set of common functions or operations that can be used across different parts of an application. The advantages of using utilities include:
